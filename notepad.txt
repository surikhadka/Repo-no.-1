Key Features of GitHub
1.	Version Control: The version control feature in GitHub, powered by Git, tracks changes to code, allows multiple developers to work simultaneously without conflicts, and maintains a history of revisions. This ensures collaboration, code integrity, and easy rollback to previous versions when needed.
2.	Collaboration: GitHub allows multiple developers to work together seamlessly on projects, enabling code reviews, discussions, and contributions through pull requests and issues. A pull request in GitHub is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows developers to share their updates, get feedback, review code, and discuss changes before merging them into the main project.
3.	Code Sharing: The code-sharing feature of GitHub enables users to easily share code snippets or entire repositories with others, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange. Gists in GitHub are a simple way to share code snippets, notes, or small projects with others.
4.	Project Management: GitHub helps teams organize and track their work using tools like issues, milestones, and project boards. It enables planning, prioritization, and progress monitoring, ensuring efficient collaboration and timely delivery of tasks.
